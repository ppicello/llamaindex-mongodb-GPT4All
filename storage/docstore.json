The belief among the scientific community at large is that the organisms are the result of disease and not the cause.

She's ...The adventurous Lady Edwina Esketh travels to the princely state of Ranchipur in India with her husband, Lord Albert Esketh, who is there to purchase some of the Maharajah's horses. She's surprised to meet an old friend, Tom Ransome who came to Ranchipur seven years before to paint the Maharajah's portrait and just stayed on. Ransome has developed something of a reputation - for womanizing and drinking too much - but that's OK with Edwina who is bored and looking for fun. She soon meets the local doctor, the hard working and serious Major Rama Safti. He doesn't immediately respond to her advances but when the seasonal rains come, disaster strikes when a dam fails, flooding much of the countryside. Disease soon sets in and everyone, including Ransome and Edwina, work at a non-stop pace to save as many as possible. Safti deeply admires Edwina's sacrifice", "doc_id": "dee908bd-bb1d-4ee7-bb87-869f7268ac76", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b117f06676c18b3c92167a0079c7e21df160f7d96c205428246b585386e15ab9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1069}, "relationships": {"1": "2a0d0184-4e4b-434a-8e9c-2fcc94365569", "3": "f7da6e27-b018-47c7-9398-9cd9cdfedb14"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7da6e27-b018-47c7-9398-9cd9cdfedb14": {"__data__": {"text": "as many as possible.
